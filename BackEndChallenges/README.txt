NOTE: 
	- Only send back the code require for the challenge.

This clearly indicates that there is no expectation for Unit Tests, Integration Tests or to implement CI/CD, and neither of a complete solution.
But just the code required from the question.

All Tasks will be tested manually before pushing.
